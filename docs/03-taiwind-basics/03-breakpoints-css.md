# Breakpoints In CSS

If I have to write the default breakpoints of tailwindss in plain css, below is how I would write.

```css
/* Small devices (640px and up)
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  /* Your css rules */
}

/* Medium devices (768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Your css rules */
}


/* Large devices (1024px and up)
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Your css rules */
}

/* Extra Large devices (1280px and up)
@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  /* Your css rules */
}

/* 2x Extra Large devices (1536px and up)
@media (min-width: 1536px) {
  /* Your css rules */
}

```

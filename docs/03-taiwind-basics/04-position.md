# Position

The `position` css property is used to specify the type of position to an html element.

This property can have the following values:

1. `static`: The default value. The element is poisitioned according to the normal flow of the document.
2. `relative`: The element is positioned relative to the normal position.
3. `absolute`: The element is positioned relative to it's nearest positioned ancestor (i.e. the nearest ancestor that is not static).
4. `fixed`: The element is poisitioned relative to the browser window.
5. `sticky`: The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

The tailwind equivalent classes for these values are `static, relative, absolute, fixed and sticky` respectively.

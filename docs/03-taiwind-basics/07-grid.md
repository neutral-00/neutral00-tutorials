# Grid

Grid is a powerfull layout system that allows us to create complex grid-based layouts.


## Basic Concepts
1. Grid Container: The parent element that will hold the grid items.
2. Grid Items: The child elements inside the grid container.
3. Properties: Various properties to control the layout, alignment and distribution of grid items.

## Key Properties
- `display: grid;` : Defines a grid container
- `grid-template-columns` : Defines the columns of the grid.
- `grid-template-rows` : Defines the rows of the grid.
- `grid-gap` or `gap` : Defines the size of the gaps between the rows and columns.
- `grid-template-areas` : Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas.
- `grid-area`: Defines a grid item's size and location within the grid.
- `justify-items` : Aligns the grid items along the row axis.
- `align-items` : Aligns the grid items along the column axis.
- `justify-content` : Aligns the entire grid along the row axis.
- `align-content` : Aligns the entire grid along the column axis.

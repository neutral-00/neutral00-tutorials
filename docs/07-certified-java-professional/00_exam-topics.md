### 01. Handling Date, Time, Text, Numeric, and Boolean Values
- Use primitives and wrapper classes, evaluate arithmetic and boolean expressions, and apply precedence rules, type conversions, and casting.
- Manipulate text using String, StringBuilder, and text blocks.
- Work with date, time, duration, period, and time-zone objects, including daylight saving time, using the Date-Time API.

### 02. Controlling Program Flow
- Create and manage control flow constructs such as if/else, switch statements and expressions, loops, and break/continue statements.

### 03. Using Object-Oriented Concepts in Java
- Declare and instantiate objects, including nested classes, and explain object lifecycles.
- Create classes, records, and define/instantiate instance and static fields, methods, constructors, and initializers.
- Implement method overloading, including var-arg methods.
- Understand variable scopes, apply encapsulation, and create immutable objects.
- Use local variable type inference.
- Implement inheritance, including abstract and sealed types, record classes, and overriding methods, including those of the Object class.
- Use polymorphism, casting, and the instanceof operator with pattern matching and switch constructs.
- Create and use interfaces with functional methods, and private, static, and default methods.
- Work with enums including fields, methods, and constructors.

### 04. Handling Exceptions
- Handle exceptions with try/catch/finally, try-with-resources, and multi-catch blocks.
- Create and use custom exceptions.

### 05. Working with Arrays and Collections
- Create and manipulate arrays, List, Set, Map, and Deque collections, including adding, removing, updating, retrieving, and sorting elements.

### 06. Working with Streams and Lambda Expressions
- Use Java Streams, including lambda expressions implementing functional interfaces, to filter, transform, process, and sort data.
- Perform decomposition, concatenation, reduction, grouping, and partitioning on sequential and parallel streams.

### 07. Packaging and Deploying Java Code
- Define and expose module content, including by reflection, and declare module dependencies.
- Compile Java code, create modular/non-modular JARs, runtime images, and implement migration to modules using unnamed/automatic modules.

### 08. Managing Concurrent Code Execution
- Create platform and virtual threads using Runnable and Callable objects.
- Manage thread lifecycles and use different ExecutorService implementations and concurrent APIs.
- Develop thread-safe code with locking mechanisms and process Java collections concurrently with parallel streams.

### 09. Using Java I/O API
- Read/write console and file data using I/O Streams.
- Serialize and deserialize Java objects.
- Work with Path objects and their properties using the java.nio.file API.

### 10. Implementing Localization
- Implement localization using locales and resource bundles.
- Parse and format messages, dates, times, and numbers, including currency and percentage values.

### 11. Additional Java Features
- Understand the basics of the Java Logging API.
- Use annotations like @Override, @FunctionalInterface, @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings, and @SafeVarargs.

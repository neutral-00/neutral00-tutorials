# JVM - JRE - JDK

Java programs are compiled into a machine independent format called bytecode. \
This code can then be shared across any machine be it windows, Linux, Mac. \
JVM specific to the platform then interpretes this bytecode to the platform specific code and runs the program.

So there is a saying, write once run anywhere.

## JVM
- It is a program written in C++. \
- JVM converts bytecode to machine specific code. \
- It also executes the converted machine code.

## JRE
- Known as Java Runtime Environment
- It includes JVM and java binaries and classes needed to execute a program.
- It provides all necessary dependencies to run a java program.

## JDK
- stands for Java Development Kit.
- It is JVM + JRE + all the tools necessary(compiler + debugger + javadoc) for developing a java program.

We can use Unified Modeling Language to
- analyse business requirements
- model code structures
- describe application deployment

## Different Types of Diagrams

1. Use Case Diagram : describes the interaction between the user and the application
2. Class Diagram: represents the different classes needed and also the relations among them.
3. Activity Diagrams: describes flow of control.
4. Sequence Diagrams: describe how one object can invoke method of another object and pass data.

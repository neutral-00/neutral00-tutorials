# Java APIs

Java comes with a number of application programming interfaces. \

For example the 

## Collections API
It contains a lot of useful Interfaces and classes. \
These classes exposes exposes methods using which progammers can easily create and manage data.
The data are actually colletion of objects.

## Java Streams API
It allow us to efficiently filter, map and reduce a large streams of data. \
Actions on these data are performed using lambda expressions.

Lambda expressions are a form for functional programming in Java.


## IO API
It has the necessary classes to tranfer data through a series of interconnected streams. \
Data can be read from various sources known as input streams. \
And can be written to various destinations known as output streams.

## Java Concurrency API
This is to take advantage of multi-core CPU architecture. \
Using this API we can execute code concurrently for better performance. \


## Java Persitence API or JPA
It enable java object relational mapping. \
Meaning Java objects can be stored as data base tables and vice-versa. \
JDBC is the protocol that enables connection to database and execute SQL statements. \

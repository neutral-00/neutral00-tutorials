# JVM

Java programs are compiled into a machine independent format called bytecode. \
This code can then be shared across any machine be it windows, Linux, Mac. \
JVM specific to the platform then interpretes this bytecode to the platform specific code and runs the program.

So there is a saying, write once run anywhere.

# Syntax

## Structure

Java codes are basically structured into class, package, module.

Class describes data and logic of the program.

Package groups related classes

Modules, introdued in Java 9, groups packages.


## Syntax

In java, codes are usually written inside a class. \
A class contains variables and methods. \

Variables hold data. \
Methods has logics that operates on the variables.

## Design Mindset

In Java, most of the things are designed around classes and objects.

A class represent a type of thing or a concept that has certain behaviour. \

An object is an instance, in other words, a specific example of a class.

## Code Reuse

In Java, code can be reused through inheritance. Attributes (variables) and behaviors(methods)
of a Parent class are inherited by a child class.


## Flexible Design

Flexible design in java are supported via interfaces, enumerations and generics.

Interfaces : are used to define contracts

Enums : are used to define user defined constants.

Generics : are used to pass specific type information to the compiler.

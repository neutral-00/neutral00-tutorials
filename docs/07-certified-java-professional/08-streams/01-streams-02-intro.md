# Streams - Intro

A stream is a sequence of elements that can be process through a pipeline.

A pipleline usually has 3 parts:
1. The Source: a collection
2. Intermediate Operations: like filtering, sorting, transforming
3. Terminal Operations like printing, saving, counting

**Note**
- Stream doesn't start until a terminal operation is added.

# Thread Lifecycle

A thread goes through different phases from creation to completion.

1. NEW : Once a thread a created it is in NEW  state. 
2. RUNNABLE : after a thread is created it will wait for cpu time. This phase is RUNNABLE.
3. RUNNING : once cpu allocates time and start execution, thread is in RUNNING state.
4. BLOCKED/WAITING: When a thread is halted and waiting for resource, it is in BLOCKED state.
5. TERMINATED: The thread has finised execution.

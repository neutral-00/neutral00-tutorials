# Java 17 Feature Overview

Here are key Java 17 features you should know for a senior developer interview:

## Must-Know Java 17 Features

- **Sealed Classes:** Allows you to restrict which classes can extend or implement a class or interface, giving better control over class hierarchies and enabling more robust domain modeling.[1][2][3]
- **Pattern Matching for Switch (Preview):** Improves switch statements by allowing type checks and extraction of values directly within case labels, making them more concise and expressive.[2][3]
- **Records:** Java records provide a compact syntax for immutable data classes, eliminating boilerplate code for getters, equals, hashCode, and toString (introduced before Java 17, but relevant as it's now stable).[4][1]
- **Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generator API:** Improved random number generation with new algorithm support and more flexible interfaces.[1][2]
- **Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals:** Internal JDK APIs are now strongly encapsulated, improving security and reliability by restricting reflective access to non-critical internal classes.[4][2]
- **Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator):** Experimental API for calling native code and managing memory outside the JVM, improving interoperability with code in other languages.[2]
- **Switch Statement Expressions:** Java 17 refines switch statements/expressions to remove fall-through, making them less error-prone and more readable with arrow (`->`) syntax.[5]
- **Deprecation & Removal of Legacy Components:** Removal of the Applet API and AOT/JIT compiler, continued evolution toward a cleaner and more maintainable language.[2]

These updates focus on better type safety, more powerful language constructs, improved performance and security, and cleaner code. Be prepared to discuss these features with examples, as well as why they matter in real-world applications.[5][1][4]

This project was created using IntelliJ. \
Followed the normal Java + Maven project creation step. \
Spring 6 was later added in the `pom.xml`

```xml title="pom.xml"
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
    <version>6.2.0</version>
</dependency>

# Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection is the most common way Spring implements IoC: dependencies are provided (injected) into an object's constructor, setters, or fields by the container.

## Types of DI

Main injection styles supported by Spring:

- Constructor injection
	- Dependencies are provided via the class constructor. Preferred for mandatory dependencies and makes the object immutable-friendly and easier to test.

- Setter injection
	- Dependencies are injected via JavaBean-style setter methods. Useful for optional dependencies.

- Field injection
	- Dependencies are injected directly into fields (usually with `@Autowired`). Less preferred because it hides dependencies and makes testing harder.

Next we need to know Beans and concepts around it.
But before that let's understand IOC Containers and
Spring Configurations.

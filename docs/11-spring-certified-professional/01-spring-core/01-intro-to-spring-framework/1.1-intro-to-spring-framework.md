# 1.1 Introduction to Spring Framework

spring is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise applications.

## Features of Spring
Spring provides a rich set of features that simplify enterprise Java development; the items below are written with the Spring Certified Professional exam in mind.

- Inversion of Control (IoC) / Dependency Injection (DI)
	- Core principle: objects are created and wired by the container rather than by application code. Supports constructor, setter and field injection; promotes loose coupling and easier testing.

- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
	- Modularizes cross-cutting concerns (logging, transactions, security) using aspects, advices and pointcuts. Can be applied declaratively via annotations or XML.

- Spring MVC (Web)
	- A flexible MVC framework for building web applications and REST APIs. Supports annotation-driven controllers, content negotiation, view resolvers and exception handling.

- Data Access and Persistence
	- Simplifies JDBC with JdbcTemplate and provides integration with JPA, Hibernate, MyBatis and Spring Data repositories for CRUD and query derivation.

- Transaction Management
	- Consistent programming model for local and global transactions; supports declarative transactions via @Transactional and programmatic control.

- Spring Boot
	- Opinionated auto-configuration and starter dependencies that drastically reduce setup and boilerplate. Includes embedded servers, production-ready defaults and quick application bootstrapping.

- Spring Security
	- Authentication and authorization framework providing filters, method-level security, OAuth2/OpenID Connect support, and extensible customization points.

- Testing Support
	- Test utilities and annotations (Spring TestContext, @SpringBootTest, @WebMvcTest) that simplify unit and integration testing with dependency injection and transaction rollback.

- Reactive Programming
	- Support for building non-blocking, event-driven applications via Project Reactor and Spring WebFlux (Flux/Mono, reactive repositories, and functional endpoints).

- REST and HTTP Client Support
	- First-class support for building RESTful services and clients (RestTemplate, WebClient, message converters, HATEOAS support).

- Integration and Messaging
	- Integration with JMS, AMQP, Kafka and Spring Integration for messaging patterns, inbound/outbound adapters, and message-driven POJOs.

- Caching
	- Abstraction over cache providers with annotation-driven caching (@Cacheable, @CacheEvict) and support for providers like EhCache, Redis, Caffeine.

- Scheduling and Asynchronous Execution
	- Task scheduling and asynchronous method execution via @Scheduled and @Async, plus executor abstractions and thread pool configuration.

- Monitoring and Production Features
	- Spring Boot Actuator for health checks, metrics, trace, and management endpoints; integrates with Micrometer and monitoring systems.

- Environment, Profiles and Externalized Configuration
	- Flexible property management (application.properties/yml), profiles for environment-specific beans, and the Environment abstraction for configuration access.

- Bean Lifecycle and Post-Processing
	- Bean scopes, lifecycle callbacks, BeanPostProcessor and FactoryBean hooks for customizing object creation and initialization.

- Validation and Data Binding
	- Integration with Jakarta Bean Validation (javax.validation / jakarta.validation), data binding and conversion support for request/response mapping.

For exam preparation: focus on concepts (IoC vs. DI), common annotations (@Component, @Configuration, @Bean, @Autowired, @Transactional), Spring Boot auto-configuration, and how Spring manages transactions and MVC request flow.

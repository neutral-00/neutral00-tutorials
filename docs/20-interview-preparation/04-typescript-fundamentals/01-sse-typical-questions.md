# Typical Senior Developer Interview Questions

Here is a list of TypeScript interview questions for a senior developer position:

- What are the main benefits of using TypeScript over plain JavaScript in large projects?
- How does TypeScript's type system improve code reliability and maintainability?
- Explain the difference between `interface` and `type` in TypeScript. When would you use each?
- What are generics and how do they help in building reusable components?
- How does TypeScript handle module resolution, and what compiler options are essential for large codebases?
- Can you explain declaration merging? Provide a practical example.
- Describe TypeScript’s structural typing system. How does it differ from nominal typing?
- What are mapped types and conditional types? When are they useful?
- How would you gradually migrate a large JavaScript project to TypeScript?
- What are union and intersection types? Show how they can be leveraged for accurate type definitions.
- How does strict type checking (`strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`, etc.) help in code quality?
- How do you configure and use TypeScript decorators in a real-world application?
- What challenges might you face when integrating legacy JavaScript libraries into a TypeScript project?
- How do you test TypeScript code, and what tools do you recommend for test coverage and quality?
- How do you handle asynchronous code with type safety (Promises, async/await) in TypeScript?
- What is type narrowing and how does control flow analysis enhance it?
- How would you organize and share types in a monorepo or across multiple packages?
- What strategies do you use for managing custom or third-party type definition files?
- How do you optimize the `tsconfig.json` for developer productivity and build performance?
- Discuss a time when advanced TypeScript features (like conditional types or template literal types) helped solve a complex business problem.

These questions emphasize advanced features, architecture, maintainability, and real-world problem-solving within TypeScript development.[1][2][3]

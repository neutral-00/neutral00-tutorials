Here is a list of TypeScript interview questions suitable for an architect-level position:

1. Explain the key advantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript in large-scale applications.
2. How does TypeScript support object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism?
3. What are generics in TypeScript? Provide examples of how you would use generics in a complex application.
4. How does TypeScript handle type inference? What strategies do you use to balance explicit typing and inference?
5. Explain declaration merging and how it can be used in designing modular and extensible APIs.
6. What are mapped types and conditional types? Give real-world use cases where they simplify type definitions.
7. Describe how TypeScript's structural typing system differs from nominal typing, and what implications this has on design.
8. How do you implement and enforce strict null checks and handle nullable types in your codebase effectively?
9. What is the difference between `interface` and `type` aliases in TypeScript? When would you use one over the other?
10. How do you configure your TypeScript compiler options (`tsconfig.json`) for optimal performance and developer experience?
11. Explain advanced features like decorators and metadata reflection in TypeScript and their architectural uses.
12. How do you approach integrating TypeScript gradually into an existing JavaScript project?
13. Discuss strategies for managing complex typings in large monorepos or multi-package repositories.
14. How do you write maintainable and reusable types in TypeScript for utility libraries or SDKs?
15. Explain how TypeScript supports asynchronous programming models, including `async/await` and Promises, with type safety.
16. What challenges have you faced regarding TypeScript and third-party JavaScript libraries, and how have you tackled them?
17. How do you leverage union and intersection types to create robust APIs?
18. Explain the benefits and limitations of TypeScript’s type narrowing and control flow analysis.
19. How do you manage version compatibility and type definition files (`@types`) in large projects?
20. Describe practical testing strategies and tools you use for TypeScript-heavy codebases.

These questions explore advanced language features, best practices, architectural design considerations, and challenges you may encounter at a senior or architect level working with TypeScript in complex applications. Preparing clear examples and real-world experiences for these topics will be valuable.[1][2][3][7][8]

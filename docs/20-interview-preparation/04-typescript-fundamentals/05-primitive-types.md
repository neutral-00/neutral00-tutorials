# Primitive Types - Typescript

The **primitive types** in TypeScript are:

- `string` – for text values (e.g., `"hello"`)
- `number` – for both integers and floating-point values (e.g., `42`, `3.14`)
- `boolean` – for `true` or `false`
- `null` – represents a deliberate absence of object value
- `undefined` – represents an uninitialized variable
- `symbol` – for unique identifiers (introduced in ES2015)
- `bigint` – for arbitrarily large integers (introduced in ES2020)

These types represent the most basic data types in JavaScript and are immutable.

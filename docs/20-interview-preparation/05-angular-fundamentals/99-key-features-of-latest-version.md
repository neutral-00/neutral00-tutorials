Key Features of Angular 21
Angular 21 focuses on performance, improved developer experience, and modern reactivity, building on the foundation of the previous releases.

• Zoneless by Default: New Angular applications no longer include Zone.js by default, leading to better performance, smaller bundle sizes, and easier debugging.
• Experimental Signal Forms: This release introduces a new, streamlined, and signal-based approach to forms, aiming for a scalable and reactive experience.
• Vitest as the New Default Test Runner: Vitest is now the stable and default unit test runner for new projects, modernizing the testing experience (though Karma and Jasmine are still supported).
• Angular Aria: A new developer preview library provides a set of unstyled, headless components built with accessibility (ARIA) as a top priority.
• AI Integration: The Angular MCP (Model, Component, Proxy) Server tools have been launched to improve AI-powered workflows and code generation, allowing AI agents to use new Angular features from day one. [3]

When I started with System Design, I honestly felt lost. Everything seemed too big — caching, sharding, databases, load balancers.
But with time, I realised it’s not about learning every technology. It’s about understanding how systems behave and why certain decisions are made.

𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞’𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐬 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐥 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐦𝐞:
🔹 1. 𝐆𝐞𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭
Understanding client–server flow, caching, load balancing, and scaling gave me a solid base. Most designs build on these concepts.

🔹 2. 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐤𝐞𝐲 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬
I focused on things that repeatedly show up:
message queues, sharding, replication, consistent hashing, SQL vs NoSQL.
Knowing when to use them matters more than knowing definitions.

🔹 3. 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤 𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐬
Studying how Instagram, WhatsApp, or Uber might work helped me connect theory with real systems instead of memorizing diagrams.

🔹 4. 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐚 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞
In interviews, clarity matters. I stick to:
requirements → high-level design → components → database → scaling → trade-offs.

🔹 5. 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐦𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐬
Discussing designs with friends improved my communication and confidence more than any tutorial.

💡 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐞
System Design becomes much simpler once your fundamentals are in place. Start small, stay consistent — the progress is surprising.

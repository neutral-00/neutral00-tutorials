## Step 8 – Design rules for **“U”**

We’ll stay consistent with **L** and **O**:

### Shape rules

* Two vertical strokes
* Rounded bottom curve (no sharp corner)
* Same stroke thickness as L
* Slight inward curve → hand-drawn feel

### Alignment rules

* Top aligns with **O** (not as tall as L)
* Baseline aligns with L and O
* Width slightly narrower than O

## Step 8.1 – SVG path for letter “U”

Here is the **U**, positioned to the right of O.

```svg
<svg
  width="160"
  height="120"
  viewBox="0 0 160 120"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

  <path
    d="
      M 40 30
      C 40 30, 55 30, 55 45
      L 55 70
      C 55 90, 65 105, 80 105
      C 95 105, 105 90, 105 70
      L 105 45
      C 105 30, 120 30, 120 45
      L 120 75
      C 120 100, 100 120, 80 120
      C 60 120, 40 100, 40 75
      Z
    "
    fill="#9ED3CF"
  />
</svg>
```

## 🧠 Why this U works

* Vertical strokes match **L**
* Bottom curve visually echoes **O**
* Feels written with the same pen
* Closed shape → clean fill
* Reads well even when scaled down

Now **LOU** is visually complete.

## Milestone reached 🎉

You now have:

* **L** → tall lead letter
* **O** → balanced oval
* **U** → grounded curve

All:

* Same color (teal)
* Same stroke logic
* Same baseline

This is exactly how professional logo construction progresses.

## What comes next (important transition)

👉 **Next step: Switch color + diagonal logic**

We’ll start drawing **“S”** in yellow, and:

* Slightly bias it *downward* to suggest the slanted paint stroke
* Prepare for the diagonal color split on the **i dot**

This is where your **“tilted scale / brush stroke” idea** starts to visually appear.

Before I draw **S**, one quick check:

**Do you want the transition from teal → yellow to be:**

1. **Hard switch** (LOU teal, SING yellow)
2. **Soft diagonal overlap** (colors meet slightly)

Reply **1 or 2**, and we continue.

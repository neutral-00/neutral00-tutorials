Perfect 👍
We’ll do a **hard color switch**:

* **LOU → teal**
* **SING → yellow**
* The *slanted paint illusion* will come from **letter positioning**, not blending.

Now let’s proceed.

## Step 9 – Drawing the letter **“S”** (first yellow letter)

This is an important letter:

* It introduces the **second color**
* It sets the *flow* for `sing`
* It should feel slightly more playful than L/O/U

---

## Step 9.1 – Design rules for **S**

### Shape rules

* Smooth top curve → inward
* Narrow waist
* Wider bottom curve
* No sharp angles
* Slight asymmetry (handwritten feel)

### Positioning rules

* Same baseline as others
* Slightly **lower visual weight** than L (helps diagonal illusion)
* Same stroke thickness

## Step 9.2 – SVG path for letter “S” (yellow)

Here is the **S**, placed after U.

```svg
<svg
  width="160"
  height="120"
  viewBox="0 0 160 120"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

  <path
    d="
      M 110 30
      C 85 30, 70 45, 70 60
      C 70 70, 80 75, 95 80
      C 115 87, 125 95, 125 110
      C 125 130, 105 145, 75 145
      C 45 145, 30 130, 30 120
      C 30 110, 45 110, 55 115
      C 65 120, 75 125, 90 125
      C 105 125, 110 118, 110 110
      C 110 100, 100 95, 85 90
      C 60 82, 45 72, 45 55
      C 45 35, 65 20, 95 20
      C 120 20, 135 30, 135 35
      Z

## 🧠 Why this “S” works

* Top curve flows **out of the U**
* Center pinch adds character
* Bottom is heavier → anchors the word
* Looks good even when small
* Clearly different personality from L, but same pen

## Visual logic so far

| Letters | Color  | Role                 |
| ------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| L O U   | Teal   | Calm, entry, balance |
| S       | Yellow | Energy, transition   |

This already starts to feel like a **two-tone brush pass**, even with a hard color switch.

## What’s next (very important letter)

👉 **Next: the letter “i”**

This includes:

* The vertical stem
* The **split-color dot** (your special idea)

We’ll:

* Draw the stem in yellow
* Draw the dot as a **circle split diagonally** into teal + yellow

Before I proceed, one micro-decision (quick):

**Do you want the dot of “i” to be:**

* A) Perfect circle
* B) Slightly oval / organic

Reply **A or B**, and we’ll draw the **i** next.

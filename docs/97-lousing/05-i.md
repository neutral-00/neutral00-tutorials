Perfect 👍
We’ll use a **/** diagonal split (top-left → bottom-right).
This direction visually reinforces the “slanted scale / brush stroke” idea.

Now let’s do this **cleanly and step by step**, starting with the **letter “i”**.

---

## Step 10 – Drawing the letter **“i”**

The letter **i** has **two independent parts**:

1. The **stem** (simple, yellow)
2. The **dot** (special: diagonally split teal + yellow)

We’ll treat them as **separate SVG groups** — this is important for control.

---

## Step 10.1 – Draw the **stem of “i”** (yellow)

Design rules:

* Same stroke thickness as other letters
* Slightly rounded top & bottom
* Shorter height than L, same as S

### SVG path: stem only

```svg
<svg
  width="80"
  height="140"
  viewBox="0 0 80 140"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

  <!-- Stem of i -->
  <path
    d="
      M 35 55
      C 35 50, 45 50, 45 55
      L 45 105
      C 45 110, 35 110, 35 105
      Z
    "
    fill="#F5D000"
  />
</svg>
```

🧠 This stem:

* Matches S/N/G stroke weight
* Has soft caps
* Leaves vertical space for the dot

---

## Step 10.2 – Draw the **dot of “i”** (split diagonally)

This is the **signature element** of your logo.

### Concept

* One circular dot
* Split along `/` diagonal
* Top-left → teal
* Bottom-right → yellow

We’ll do this with **two triangular-curved paths** inside the same circle.

---

### SVG paths: split dot

```svg
<svg
  width="80"
  height="80"
  viewBox="0 0 80 80"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

  <!-- Top-left half (teal) -->
  <path
    d="
      M 40 10
      C 22 10, 10 22, 10 40
      L 40 40
      Z
    "
    fill="#9ED3CF"
  />

  <!-- Bottom-right half (yellow) -->
  <path
    d="
      M 40 40
      L 70 40
      C 70 58, 58 70, 40 70
      C 22 70, 10 58, 10 40
      Z
    "
    fill="#F5D000"
  />
</svg>
```

## 🧠 Why this dot works

* Clean diagonal `/` split
* Colors meet **inside the same shape**
* Reads as intentional, not accidental
* Scales perfectly
* Becomes a **brand signature**

This dot alone communicates:

> “Two forces, one word, balanced diagonally.”

---

## Mental checkpoint ✅

At this point you have:

* L O U → teal
* S i (stem) → yellow
* **i dot → diagonal teal + yellow**

This is exactly where the diagonal story **begins** — subtly, but unmistakably.

---

## Next step

👉 **Next letter: “N”**

* Yellow
* Same stroke logic
* Slight forward momentum

After **N**, we’ll finish with **G**, then:

* Group everything
* Align spacing
* Finalize the logo SVG

Before I draw **N**, quick check:

**Do you want the “i” dot to be:**

* Slightly closer to the stem
* Or exactly centered above it (current look)

Reply:

* **Closer**
* **Centered**

Then we continue 🚀

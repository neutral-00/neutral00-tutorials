Perfect 👍
We’ll keep the **“i” dot centered** — that keeps the logo calm and intentional.

Now let’s move to **Step 11: Drawing the letter “N”**.

---

## Step 11 – Drawing the letter **“N”** (yellow)

The **N** is important because:

* It carries momentum toward the final letter
* It should feel slightly *forward-leaning* without actually slanting
* It must stay consistent with the same “pen”

---

## Step 11.1 – Design rules for **N**

### Shape rules

* Left vertical stroke
* Right vertical stroke
* Soft diagonal connector
* Rounded joins (no sharp corners)
* Same stroke thickness as **S** and **i**

### Visual intent

* Feels handwritten, not geometric
* Slight energy toward the right (suggests flow)

---

## Step 11.2 – SVG path for letter “N”

Here is the **N**, positioned after the “i”.

```svg
<svg
  width="160"
  height="140"
  viewBox="0 0 160 140"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

  <path
    d="
      M 35 45
      C 35 40, 50 40, 50 45
      L 50 105

      C 50 110, 55 110, 60 105
      L 100 55

      C 105 50, 120 50, 120 60
      L 120 105

      C 120 110, 105 110, 105 105
      L 105 70

      L 65 115

      C 60 120, 35 115, 35 105
      Z
    "
    fill="#F5D000"
  />
</svg>
```

## 🧠 Why this “N” works

* Vertical strokes match **i** and **S**
* Diagonal stroke is soft, not rigid
* Rounded joins keep handwriting illusion
* Slight forward energy without tilting

The word now reads clearly as:

> **LOU S i N**

And visually, the yellow section feels energetic but controlled.

## What’s left 🎯

👉 **Final letter: “G”**

This is the most expressive letter:

* Curves
* Tail
* Closing flourish

Once **G** is done:

* We group all letters
* Align spacing
* Produce the **final full SVG logo**

Before I draw **G**, one stylistic choice (last one, promise 😄):

**Do you want the tail of “G” to:**

* A) Stay inside the letter (compact)
* B) Slightly dip below the baseline (playful)

Reply **A or B**, and we finish strong 💪

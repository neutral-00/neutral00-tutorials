Perfect 👍
We’ll keep the **G compact**, fully contained, clean, and logo-friendly.

This is the **final letter**, so after this we’ll be ready to assemble the full SVG.

---

## Step 12 – Drawing the letter **“G”** (yellow, compact)

The **G** should:

* Echo the roundness of **O**
* Stay readable at small sizes
* Finish the word confidently without flourish overload

---

## Step 12.1 – Design rules for **G**

### Shape rules

* Rounded outer shape (like O)
* Inner counter (hole)
* Short horizontal bar inside to indicate “G”
* No tail below baseline
* Same stroke thickness as the rest

### Visual intent

* Calm ending
* No visual “drop” (since you chose A)
* Keeps the logo balanced

---

## Step 12.2 – SVG path for letter “G”

Here is the **G**, positioned after N.

```svg
<svg
  width="170"
  height="140"
  viewBox="0 0 170 140"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

  <path
    d="
      M 90 30
      C 115 30, 135 50, 135 75
      C 135 100, 115 120, 90 120
      C 60 120, 40 100, 40 75
      C 40 50, 60 30, 90 30

      M 90 45
      C 70 45, 55 58, 55 75
      C 55 92, 70 105, 90 105
      C 105 105, 115 98, 115 90
      L 95 90
      C 90 90, 90 80, 95 80
      L 125 80
      C 130 80, 130 95, 125 100
      C 115 115, 105 120, 90 120
      Z
    "
    fill="#F5D000"
    fill-rule="evenodd"
  />
</svg>
```

## 🧠 Why this “G” works

* Matches **O**’s roundness → visual rhyme
* Internal bar clearly signals “G”
* No tail = clean finish
* Reads well even when scaled down
* Ends the word without stealing focus

## 🎉 Letter construction is complete

You now have:

| Letter    | Color         | Notes              |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| L         | Teal          | Tall lead          |
| O         | Teal          | Rounded            |
| U         | Teal          | Balanced           |
| S         | Yellow        | Transition         |
| i         | Yellow        | Stem               |
| ● (i dot) | Teal + Yellow | Diagonal split `/` |
| N         | Yellow        | Forward flow       |
| G         | Yellow        | Compact finish     |

This is **exactly how a professional logo is built**:
shape first, color logic second, meaning embedded subtly.

## Next step (assembly phase)

👉 **Step 13: Assemble the full logo SVG**

We will:

1. Place all letters on one canvas
2. Align baseline & spacing
3. Group by color
4. Define reusable colors as CSS variables
5. Output the **final, production-ready SVG**

You asked earlier to see the *complete code later* — that’s **exactly the next step**.

When you’re ready, say:

> **“Assemble the full logo SVG”**

And we’ll do it cleanly, in one final pass 🧩✨

# Mahamrityunjaya Mantra

The word महामृत्युंजय (Mahamrityunjaya) is a compound of three Sanskrit terms:  
- महा (Maha) means "great"  
- मृत्यु (Mrityu) means "death"  
- जय (Jaya) means "victory" or "conquest"  

Thus, महामृत्युंजय literally means "The Great Victory over Death." It signifies conquering or transcending the cycle of death and rebirth. This name emphasizes Lord Shiva’s power as the conqueror of death and the liberator of souls from mortality and suffering.

In a spiritual context, it conveys overcoming not just physical death but also ignorance and limitations, attaining eternal bliss and immortality through divine grace. The Mahamrityunjaya Mantra invokes this supreme victory, seeking protection, healing, and liberation.[1][2][3]

# Code Editing Movements

Let's see some of the movements we need to perform while editing code.

gd : Go to defn of what is under the cursor

gf : Go to file import

%  : Go to matching brace

Ctrl-o : Jump back to last cursor location

Ctrl-i : Jump forward cursor locations

:::Tip

Move faster with count and motion.
Syntax is {count}motion

Like 2w to move by 2 words
Like 5j to move down by 5 lines
